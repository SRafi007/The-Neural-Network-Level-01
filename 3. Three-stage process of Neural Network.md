# 🧠 Learning in Neural Networks

Learning in neural networks follows a structured, three-stage process:

## 🔄 The Learning Cycle

1. **Input Computation** 📥
   - Data is fed into the network
   - Raw information is processed through input layers
   - Features are extracted automatically
   
2. **Output Generation** ⚡
   - Based on the current parameters, the network generates an output
   - Each neuron contributes to the final prediction
   - Activation functions determine neuron behavior

3. **Iterative Refinement** 🎯
   - The network refines its output by adjusting weights and biases
   - Gradual improvement through backpropagation
   - Performance enhances with each training iteration
