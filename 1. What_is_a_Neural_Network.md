# What is a Neural Network? ü§ñ

Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns, and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making.

### Key Components:
- **Neurons**: Basic units that receive inputs, governed by a threshold and an activation function.
- **Connections**: Links between neurons that carry information, regulated by weights and biases.
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that determine the strength and influence of connections.
- **Propagation Functions**: Mechanisms that help process and transfer data across layers of neurons.
- **Learning Rule**: The method that adjusts weights and biases over time to improve accuracy.
